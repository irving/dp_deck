## Wait! Is there really that much crime?

* The FBI keeps track of violent crime in the U.S.
* The data are public.
* So we downloaded the data for the most violent crimes (murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault) for most of the past 50 years and graphed it to see what's what. See?

## But is that the whole story?

<div class="emphatic">
If we look only at one crime - murder - the picture looks noticeably different, though, doesn't it?
</div>

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}
    library(ggplot2); library(scales)
    csv <- read.csv("working_files/CrimeTotal.csv", header=FALSE, skip=6)
    c2 <- csv[1:53,c(1, 4)]
    colnames(c2) <- c("year", "murders")
    c2$year <- as.factor(c2$year)
    years <- seq(1960, 2012, 5)
    ggplot(data=c2, aes(x=year, y=murders, group=1)) + geom_point() + geom_line(size=1, aes(col=murders)) + geom_smooth() +
    scale_x_discrete(name="year", breaks = years, labels=as.character(years))

```

## Look closer at the data

* The initial plot makes it look like aggravated assault rules and murder and rape are insignificant. 
* The second plot shows that this was at least partly an illusion, created by the differing scales of the different crimes.
* So if you want to get a better understanding of violence in America the last many years, what do you do?
